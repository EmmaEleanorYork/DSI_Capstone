#In this project, I will scrap various webpages to locate where products are discussed for the first time.

#I know that I have a lot of work to do still, and I plan on investing a lot of time this weekend in it. Along with after the course is over.

#My biggest issue was getting the data I needed. Now that I have that, I will create a classification model to determine which subreddit to target to eventually get featured on Sephora.
